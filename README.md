# Financial Portfolio using React.js
> MPCS 52553 Web Development Final Project

## Overview
This is a toy financial portfolio built using React.js. It tracks actual, real-time stock prices using API calls to [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/), and allows the user to build a financial portfolio by "buying" and "selling" shares. The application will store your portfolio so you will see your shares if you reload the app in the same browser. The app also shows you how the overall market is doing on any given day.

To get started, clone this repository and run the following:
```
fp$ npm install
fp$ npm start
```

However, you will need to add your own API key, which you can get for free at [IEX Cloud](https://iexcloud.io/). Without a key, the app will still launch but you won't be able to see updated prices. 

To actually view the working application, go [here](https://dsharm.github.io/financialportfolio/). This GitHub page is being hosted by a private repo.
